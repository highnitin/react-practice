				Monolith vs Microservices

Monolith
Example of a company where every thing is authentication, api, ui service, backend service, database services, sms sending etc written in the same services.
Drawback - if we want to do a small change again we need to compile the bulky code and do the task.


Microservices

All small services combine together forms a big application

micro services talk to each other 
depending upon the use case.

having separate services for each thing example backend services, ui services, authentication services, database services, sms services, email services. this is know as separation of concern and single responsibility principle as it follows single responsibility principle as each service has it own job, and they dont interfer with each other.

- Interview Nuggets Deployment cycle will be different for each team

how these services talk to each other using API

how these services are deployed and how we can access them?

we can use different tech stack in  microservices architecture. Multiple tech stack can be used based on the use case.

all the services run on their own specific port.

example :1234 ui service
:1000 backend service
:3000 - sms service

and all these serives will be mapped to a domain name.

how they interact? they make a call to the url /api /sms /ui etc which is the port number

2 ways how web app & ui applications fetch data from backed

1. As soon as our page loads we can make the api call and render the ui

suppose time to load = 500ms then it shows the ui after 500ms
Approach -
loads - api - render

2. As soon as the page loads, we will quicky render ui skeleton - and now we will make API call and then renders the data
Approach -
loads - render -
api - render

For better ux follow approach 2

It's not a good practice to show a lot of information in a small frame of time, so rendering of ui skeleton gives the user idea about what information is gonna load and then after render it makes sense.

React renders the data efficiently

React's render cycle is fast af, react has one of the best render mechanism.

react hooks are nothing but a normal javascript function that have some specific use cases.

			</li>
			<li>
				- useEffect(); import userEffect it takes two arguements. 1. callback
				function 2. dependency array
			</li>
			<li>
				whatever we pass inside the callback function will be called after the
				ui component is rendered.
			</li>
			<li>
				Explain the rendering process when we use useEffect(). Hint - use
				browser debugger
			</li>
			<li>Fetch is a super power given by javascript or browser?</li>
			<li>Can we use swiggy's api in our local ?</li>
			<li>
				What is the error below? localhost/:1 Access to fetch at
				'https://www.swiggy.com/dapi/restaurants/list/v5?lat=21.1372529&lng=79.058856&is-seo-homepage-enabled=true&page_type=DESKTOP_WEB_LISTING'
				from origin 'http://localhost:1234' has been blocked by CORS policy: No
				'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested
				resource. If an opaque response serves your needs, set the request's
				mode to 'no-cors' to fetch the resource with CORS disabled.
			</li>
			<li>
				Who is blocking us? our browser is not allowing us to call swiggy's api
				from localhost i'e from one origin to another origin
			</li>
			<li>how to we bypass the cors?</li>
			<li>explain the concept of shimmer ui?</li>
			<li>what is conditional rendering?</li>
			<li>rendering according to the condition</li>
			<li>why do we even need useState variables</li>
			<li>explain with login and logout button example.</li>
			<li>
				js variables does not work in such situation. this is why we use local
				state variable
			</li>
			<li>where does the use state come from? - import usestate</li>
			<li>
				when we use useState the local varibable behaves like a normal
				javascript variable but it has a special powers
			</li>
			<li>
				whenever the state variable is changed/updated react will re render the
				component where we have the state variable. it triggers the
				reconcillation cycle
			</li>
			<li>
				question - onclicking the login button what will be rendered only the
				button or the complete header component?
			</li>
			<li>
				what is mean by rendering the component again? it means calling the
				function component again.
			</li>
			<li>
				const [variable1, setVariable1] = useState("Login"), if we are using
				const variable then how it is getting updated? isn't it defeats the
				purpose of const variable? this is where reconcillation works, and diff
				algorigthm works
