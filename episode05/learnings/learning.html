		<h1>Curious Cat - (ignore typos)</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Clean you code</li>
			<li>Add the project file under src folder</li>
			<li>
				Point below is a small summary of the episode 05, will work on a
				descriptive version later in the session.
			</li>
			<li>
				what is the difference between import header.js and import header.jsx
			</li>
			<li>
				what is the differnce between components/header.js and
				components/header.jsx
			</li>
			<li>
				Note - never keep hardcoded data like string ulr, variable example const
				restaurantList = [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}] etc in component file.
			</li>

			<li>
				Keep your folder name anything as per your choice but try to follow
				industry standards - common, config, utils (folder name can be named
				anything as per industry standard)
			</li>
			<li>
				For all the constant variable use capital letter naming convention utils
				> constants.js example const LOGO_URL = "xyz";
			</li>
			<li>
				Question why react is fast? react is fast in dom manipulation state
			</li>
			<li>
				what is variable in react - super powerful variable hooks in react known
				as useState
			</li>
			<li>
				a hook - is a normal js function only thing is this function is utility
				function given some superpowerful powers.
			</li>
			<li>hook is a normal js utility functions</li>
			<li>there are two most important hooks in react:</li>
			<li>
				1. useState() - used to generate superpowerful state variables in react
			</li>
			<li>2. useEffect() - it maintains the state of the component.</li>
			<li>
				whenever a state variable is updated/changed react re renders the
				component.
			</li>
			<li>read more on import</li>
			<li>read more about named export, defaul export and * as export.</li>
			<li>read more on react hooks</li>
			<li>why do we need a useState hook?</li>
			<li>
				react hook is a utility function that gives you some utility. example -
				const [data, setData] = useState({});
			</li>
			<li>
				react will keep a sync between the ui layer and the data layer. in the
				data layer when you have a local state variable as soon as the data
				layer is update the ui layer will update. how will it update? by re
				rendering the component.
			</li>
			<li>react is good at dom manipulation</li>
			<li>
				as soon as we change the state variable react re renders the component.
			</li>
			<li>read more on - react fiber architecture by acdlite (git readme)</li>
			<li>read more on reconciliation</li>
			<li>
				react is doing efficient dom manipulation. how? as it has a virtual dom
			</li>
			<li>
				virtual dom as a concept existed from a long time. react took that and
				build an algorithm on top that.
			</li>
			<li>
				react efficiently find out the difference between virtual dom and update
				the ui
			</li>
			<li>
				why react is fast? is has virtual dom, it has dif algorithm which is
				very fast.
			</li>
