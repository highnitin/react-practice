## Project Learnings

1. **Clean Your Code**
   - Keep your code organized and well-structured.

2. **Add the Project File Under src Folder**
   - Place your project files under the src folder.

3. **Summary of Episode 05**
   - A small summary of the fifth episode. A more detailed version will be provided later in the session.

4. **Difference Between `import header.js` and `import header.jsx`**
   - Understand the distinction between importing JavaScript and JSX files.

5. **Difference Between `components/header.js` and `components/header.jsx`**
   - Explore the differences between JavaScript and JSX files within the components folder.

6. **Avoid Hardcoding Data in Component Files**
   - Never hardcode data like string URLs or variables directly in component files.

7. **Follow Industry Standards for Folder Naming**
   - Choose folder names according to industry standards (common, config, utils).

8. **Use Capital Letter Naming for Constants**
   - For constant variables, follow the naming convention of using capital letters (e.g., `LOGO_URL = "xyz"`).

9. **Why React is Fast?**
   - React is fast in DOM manipulation and state management.

10. **React Variables - Super Powerful Hooks**
   - Understand the power of state variables in React, achieved through hooks like `useState`.

11. **Hooks in React**
   - Hooks are normal JavaScript utility functions with powerful capabilities.

12. **Important React Hooks**
   - There are two crucial hooks in React: `useState()` and `useEffect()`.

13. **useState() Hook**
   - `useState()` is used to generate superpowerful state variables in React.

14. **useEffect() Hook**
   - `useEffect()` maintains the state of the component.

15. **State Variable Updates and React Rerender**
   - Whenever a state variable is updated, React re-renders the component.

16. **Read More on Import**
   - Explore more about the `import` statement in JavaScript.

17. **Named Export, Default Export, and * as Export**
   - Learn more about different export methods in JavaScript.

18. **Read More on React Hooks**
   - Dive deeper into the concept of React hooks.

19. **Why Do We Need a useState Hook?**
   - Understand the significance of the `useState` hook in React.

20. **React Fiber Architecture and Reconciliation**
   - Read more about React Fiber architecture and the concept of reconciliation.

21. **Efficient DOM Manipulation with Virtual DOM**
   - React efficiently manipulates the DOM using the virtual DOM.

22. **Virtual DOM in React**
   - Explore the concept of the virtual DOM in React.

23. **React Fiber Algorithm**
   - Understand the React Fiber algorithm for efficient DOM updates.

24. **React's Efficiency in DOM Manipulation**
   - Learn why React is fast, with features like virtual DOM and a fast diff algorithm.

25. **Additional Reading on React Fiber by Acdlite**
   - Check out the React Fiber architecture in Acdlite's GitHub readme.

26. **Reconciliation in React**
   - Gain insights into how React efficiently reconciles changes in the virtual DOM.

27. **React's Virtual DOM vs. Actual DOM**
   - Understand the difference between React's virtual DOM and the actual DOM.

28. **Why React is Fast - Virtual DOM and Diff Algorithm**
   - Explore why React is fast, with its virtual DOM and efficient diff algorithm.
