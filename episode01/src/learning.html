    <h1>Curious Cat - (ignore typos)</h1>
    <ul>

        <li>document.createElement("h1") this is a method used to create element in this case h1 is the element</li>
        
        <li>how does the browser understand document.createElement? innerHTML? createElement?
            <ul>
        <li>Ans: When you call document.createElement("h1"), you're invoking a method provided by the browser's DOM implementation. Browsers have built-in JavaScript engines (like V8 in Chrome, SpiderMonkey in Firefox, and others) that understand and execute JavaScript code. When this method is called, the browser's JavaScript engine processes it and creates a new DOM element in memory.</li>
    </ul>
</li>

<li>what is CDN? why do we use CDN? alternative for CDN?
    <ul>
        <li>- one is the core of React</li>
        <li>- the other is the library for DOM operations</li>
    </ul>
</li>

<li>secret internals do not use? what's that?</li>

<li>what is cross-origin? why am I writing crossorigin? alternative for cross-origin?</li>

<li>does the order of the script matter? What will happen if I alter the position of the script?</li>

<li>why is the script written under the body tag? Can we add it under the head?</li>

<li>why are there two links in React CDN? why did React make two files?</li>

<li>what is a React element?</li>

<li>what is production.js file and development.js file in React?</li>

<li>if something, let's say, an h1 tag is already present in the id=root, and you try to render other elements using ReactElement, what will happen?
    <ul>
        <li>Ans: The root render will replace the tag.</li>
    </ul>
</li>

<li>what if we have an h1 tag on top of the root?</li>

<li>read more about props.</li>

<li>change the order of the script and see if the code is working properly.</li>

<li>part of React can be used in any application using CDN - read more on it.</li>

<li>React can work on your existing apps as well. React can be used in a part of the application.</li>

<li>React has helper functions that help to build faster applications.</li>

<li>NPM doesn't stand for - Node Package Manager.</li>

<li>package.json is a configuration for NPM.</li>

<li>bundler - Parcel, Webpack, Wheat</li>

<li>there are two types of dependencies - 1. Dev dependencies & 2. Normal dependencies</li>

<li>difference between caret and tilde</li>

<li>what is a transitive dependency.</li>
<li>how to inject script file? when we add app.js in index.html it is called as?</li>
