# NamasteReact Series - Episode 01 Learnings

Welcome to the documentation of my learnings from Episode 01 of the NamasteReact series. In this episode, we covered a variety of topics related to JavaScript and React. Here's a summary of what I've learned:

1. **Creating Elements with `document.createElement`**
   - `document.createElement("h1")` is a method used to create an HTML element, in this case, an h1 element.

2. **Understanding Browser's DOM Implementation**
   - Browsers have built-in JavaScript engines (e.g., V8 in Chrome, SpiderMonkey in Firefox) that process JavaScript code.
   - `document.createElement` invokes the browser's DOM implementation, creating a new DOM element in memory.

3. **Content Delivery Network (CDN) and React Links**
   - CDN is used to deliver static assets like JavaScript libraries.
   - React CDN has two links - one for the core of React and the other for DOM operations.

4. **Cross-Origin and `crossorigin` Attribute**
   - Explored the concept of cross-origin and the use of `crossorigin` attribute.
   - Alternative solutions for handling cross-origin scenarios.

5. **Script Order and Placement**
   - Explored the importance of the order and placement of script tags in HTML.
   - Experimented with altering the script position to observe the impact on code execution.

6. **React Element and Rendering**
   - Learned about React elements and how React renders content to the DOM.
   - Handling scenarios where an element is already present in the DOM.

7. **Understanding React CDN Files**
   - Explored the purpose of `production.js` and `development.js` files in React.

8. **Usage of Props in React**
   - Encouraged to read more about props and their role in React components.

9. **NPM and Package Management**
   - Clarified that NPM doesn't stand for "Node Package Manager."
   - `package.json` serves as a configuration file for NPM.

10. **Bundlers and Dependency Types**
    - Introduced to bundlers like Parcel, Webpack, and Wheat.
    - Discussed the difference between dev dependencies and normal dependencies.

11. **Dependency Versioning with Caret and Tilde**
    - Explored the difference between caret (`^`) and tilde (`~`) in specifying dependency versions.

12. **Transitive Dependency**
    - Defined and understood the concept of transitive dependencies in a project.

13. **Injecting Script Files and Log Behavior**
    - Explored how script files are injected, specifically mentioning adding `app.js` in `index.html`.
    - Discussed the behavior of logging in JavaScript.
