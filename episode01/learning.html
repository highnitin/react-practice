    document.createElement("h1") this is a method used to create element in this case h1 is the element
    
    how browser understand this document? innerHTML? createElement? 
    Ans: When you call document.createElement("h1"), you're invoking a method provided by the browser's DOM implementation.
    Browsers have built-in JavaScript engines (like V8 in Chrome, SpiderMonkey in Firefox, and others) that understand and
    execute JavaScript code. When this method is called, the browser's JavaScript engine processes it and creates a new
    
    DOM element in memory.
