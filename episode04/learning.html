		<h1>Curious Cat - (ignore typos)</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Before we start coding, make a conceptual design of your application. or
				a wire frame.
			</li>
			<li>Make a low level design of working of your application.</li>
			<li>Start working with React Props</li>
			<li>Props are just normal arguments to the function.</li>
			<li>
				Passing arguments to the function is same as passing props to the
				functional components.
			</li>
			<li>How can we ready the props?</li>
			<li>
				When we want to dynamically pass some data to the components we pass in
				as a props.
			</li>
			<li>What is Config driven UI</li>
			<li>
				All the ui is driven by a config what is the config? the data, api is
				the config. Example, swiggy have offer for delhi, mumbai, nagpur, etc.
				or some place there is no offer. So do we need to build different ui for
				all the location? No. Let's consider a carousel which shows offers from
				different city, we have written ui once, and now according to the data
				coming from the backend ui is getting changed. this is called config
				driven ui. another example if we want to show different color in
				festival in particular city, we just need to update the backend data,
				and then config will drive the ui.
			</li>
			<li>
				In any react application, there is a ui layer and data layer and both of
				them together builds a frontend application. UI layer engineer, data
				layer engineer
			</li>
			<li>Why do we have warning as each list must have a unique key?</li>
			<li>Never use react index as keys</li>
