    <h1>Curious Cat - (ignore typos)</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Create a script so you don't have to run npm commands again and again.</li>
        <li>add script for starting the dev environment and parcel build for push app to production ready code. </li>
        <li>npm start === npm parcel index.html</li>
        <li>npm run start === npm parcel index.html</li>
        <li>npm run build === npx parcel build index.html</li>
        <li>React.createElement() - what is does? creates an object and when we render this element on to the DOM then
            it becomes a html element.</li>
        <li>Fun part - we can build react application without jsx, jsx makes developers life easy.</li>
        <li>JSX is a convention where we kinda of merge html and js</li>
        <li> JSX is not html written inside javascript </li>
        <li> Instead, JSX is a html lookalike or XML lookalike syntax </li>
        <li>We can create reactElement using core React. We can also create reactElement using JSX.</li>
        <li>As a programmer and developer, do we write code for machine or humans? Answer is vauge, we write it for
            both. Human first and then machine second.</li>
        <li>Can js engine read jsx? No js engine can only understand the code written in javascript.</li>
        <li>Then how jsx is working? Parcel is responsible. The code we write even before the code reaches to the js
            engine it is transpiled (transpiled means this code is converted to a code that browser can understand, that
            react can understand) before it goes to the js engine. and then js engine receives the code the browsers can
            understand.</li>
        <li>who is transpiling the code? Parcel is responsible, not working alone it gives the responsibility to the
            pacakage called babel.</li>
        <li>Using React </li>
        <li>React.createElement => ReactElement - JS Object => HTMLElement(render)</li>
        <li>Using JSX</li>
        <li> JSX => babel transpiles it to React.createElement => ReactElement - JS Object => HTMLElement(render)</li>
        <li>Read more on babel and parcel</li>
        <li>how babel works? babel reads the code token by token, and .. (continue your research)</li>
        <li>Add to class to the react element created using jsx</li>
        <li>Attributes are added as a camelcase in jsx example background-color should be written as backgroundColor
            (please verify)</li>
        <li>Explore various attributes of various tags.</li>
        <li>Single line and multiple line in JSX - to write JSX in multiple line wrap the code in (). example.
            <pre>const heading = (<h1>Hello Developer<h1>) </pre></li>
        <li>What are react components? - 2 ways of creating react components : class based components, functional
            components. </li>
        <li>Functional components are nothing but just a javascript function that returns some piede of jsx code.</li>
        <li>as jsx code is nothing but a react element so </li>
        <li>Functional components are nothing but just a javascript function that returns react element or elements.</li>
        <li><pre>example 1. const Function = () => {return <h1 class="heading">Hello Dveloper</h1>}</pre></li>
        <li><pre>example 2. const Function = () => {return <div><h1 class="heading">Hello Dveloper</h1></div>}</pre></li>
        <li><pre>example 3. const Function = function () {return <div><h1 class="heading">Hello Dveloper</h1></div>}</pre> here it must have a return statement.</li>
        <li>naming convention for functional components starts with Capital letter followed by small case. example -
            Function1(), Addition(), Header() and likewise.</li>
        <li>What is the difference between react element and funtional component?</li>
        <li>What is component composition? basic idea - adding components inside component. Composing components into one another is nothing but component composition. </li>
        <li>We can write javascript inside jsx. if you add {} inside functional component, the function component will have the superpower and we can write any piece of javascript there.</li>
        <li>How can we put react element inside the component. using {}, {element}</li>
        <li>How can we put react element inside the element. using {}, {element}</li>
        <li>How can we put react components inside the element. using angular </><component/> or using <component></component>
        here are the ways - {HeadingFunction5()}, <HeadingFunction5></HeadingFunction5>, <HeadingFunction5 />
        </li>
        <li>How jsx sanitizes the data? Assume that you had a cross scripting attack, how jsx handles it? how it prevents cross scripting attack?</li>
        <li>What makes the web app react code readable and faster? code is readable because we are writing JSX. how to proof this? write code where createElement using core react. </li>
        <li>At the end of the day it is all about javascript.</li>
        
    </ul>
