					useEffect Hook

					When useEffect is called?
					It is called after every render of the component. Everytime the component renders useEffect is called.
				
				Dependency array changes the behaviour if useEffect hook.
				
				if no dependency array present => useEffect is called on every render
				
				if dependency array is empty [] => useEffect is called on intial render (just once)
				
				The default behaviour of useEffect is to be called again and again if the component renders.
				
				If dependency array is [something] => useEffect is called when [something] is updated.
				
				Remember useEffect is called once on all conditions.
				
				------------------------
				
				useState Hook
				
				Never create useState hooks outside the components.
				
				It is used to create local state variable inside your functional component.
				
				Bad Practice:
				
				- Creating useState outside functional component
				
				- Using useState inside conditinal statement, example if(condition){useState}
				
				- Never use it inside for loop
				
				- Don't create your state variables inside functions (functions created inside functional components).
				
				Good Practice:
				
				- Place your useState at the top level of functional component
				
				---------------------
